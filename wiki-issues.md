#Wiki issues
We're trying to have this wiki up to date and errors free, but if you still see an issue with it, please report an issue
using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/the-shop/Wiki/issues) page.

Try to be as detailed as much as possible and we'll do our best to fix the issue as soon as possible.

If you have need for immediate feedback on anything make sure you've sent your Slack user handle and that you have access to company Slack channel. Find #onboarding channel and ask your questions there.

Note that you should read through entire wiki before you ping anyone on Slack as your XP might get deducted if question you have is already fully covered somewhere on Wiki.

## Moving further
Please go back to main [README.md](README.md) and read through rest of it.
