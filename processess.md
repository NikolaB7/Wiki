For student roles, expectation is to to ping your mentor once a day with relevant update if you're currently working on something. If you're not working on anything there are no expectations and there's no need to ping anyone.

Updates can be anything from "I won't be available for next 4 days" to "I've commited partial fix to bug XYZ and have submitted a diff for review".

  1. Explain code review process
  2. Availabity definition and expectations
