#Processes

List of all internal processes.

## Reporting progress
Everyone who's currently working on something should give daily updates to rest of the project team. If developer is not working on anything there are no expectations and there's no need to ping anyone.

Updates can be anything from "I won't be available for next 4 days" to "I've commited partial fix to bug XYZ and have submitted a diff for review".

## Trello
All projects are managed using Trello boards. There are 4 standard lists in each of the project boards:
  1. Information
    - Contains relevant info on the project
  2. Pending
    - All newly created actionable items that are still not in progrees
    - Items could be assigned to someone but can be still unassigned when at this list
  3. Doing
    - When developer starts working on item that's from "Pending" list he moves it to this list so team has visibility on what's being done by who at all times
    - Only assigned tickets can be moved to this list
  4. Done
    - When developer is done with work scoped by their ticket they move the ticket to "Done" board
  
Notes:
  - Developers have the responsiblity to keep items assigned to them in correct list and update them as needed (comments, moving from list to list, etc.)
  - Developer can work on mulitple tickets at same time if blocked by others for example - but usuall flow should be one ticket at the time
